Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms.
It involves training models on data to make predictions or decisions.
Common ML techniques include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
Popular frameworks include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn.
ML is used in recommendation systems, image recognition, and natural language processing.
Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers.
Feature engineering is crucial for traditional ML approaches.
