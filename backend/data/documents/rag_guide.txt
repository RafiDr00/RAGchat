Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) combines document retrieval with language models.
RAG systems first search for relevant documents, then use them to generate answers.
This approach reduces hallucination and provides grounded responses.
RAG is particularly useful for question-answering systems and chatbots.
The process involves embedding documents, storing them in a vector database, and retrieving similar content.
Vector similarity is typically measured using cosine similarity.
RAG can be enhanced with hybrid search combining keyword and semantic search.
