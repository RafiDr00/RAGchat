Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction and feedback

Applications:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Anomaly detection

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) enhances LLMs by providing grounded context from external documents.
